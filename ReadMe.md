# Flexbox Simplified - Layouts

This is a page of linked layouts and patterns from Kevin Powell's class Flexbox Simplified compiled on a single page for my own personal reference and ease of use. It illustrates many examples of the power of flexbox and properties that can be used in responsive design. These pages can be used as starter templates or base code in projects but code itself is written by Kevin. His classes can be found at: https://www.kevinpowell.co/
